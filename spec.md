# Game Overview: Rolling Sky
Inspired by the mobile game Rolling Sky, this game is a single player obstacle dodging game where the player controls arrows keys to jump, move sides ways. 
The objective is to survive, avoid obstacles, and reach finish line without falling from the sky. 
The game will use a 2D top-down perspective to simulate the original Rolling Sky experience.

## Controls:
Left arrow key: Move the ball left.
Right arrow key: Move the ball right.
Up arrow key: Jump

# Why it is fun
The game challenges players' reaction times and coordination. As the ball progresses, obstacles become increasingly difficult to avoid.
